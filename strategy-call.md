<h1 class="join-us">Free Real Estate Business Planning Call</h1>
<h5 class="join-us-subtitle">Are you a hungry real estate agent looking for more?</h5>

<p>Dear Fellow Agent:</p>

<p>Need direction and focus to sell more homes?</p>

<p>I’ll meet with you one-on-one to help you write a business plan you can implement immediately to generate leads, appointments, and sales. </p>

<p>I know how challenging it is to sell real estate.</p>

<p>You have discount brokerages, competing agents, and hundreds of ways to get clients (all are not equal, I’ll tell you).</p>

<p>It can get overwhelming to stick to a consistent business plan that makes you money.</p>

<p>My name is Katrina Madewell and we’ve sold thousands of homes. </p>

<p>I want to help you sell more homes.</p>

<p>I’ll learn about your needs, goals, and why you started selling real estate. I’m happy to offer my insight on what I would do in your situation to sell more homes.</p>

<p>I will also share with you what we’re doing that works to generate leads and sales. </p>

<p>Once I understand how you like to do business that’s authentic to you (referral, prospecting, marketing, events, etc), I’ll help you write a business plan tailored just for you.</p>

<p>You’ll walk away with a plan of action, with steps you can take right away, to find homeowners who will list their home with you and buyers looking to purchase homes. </p>

<p>This will help you get the commission consistency and the freedom we all want from our business and the ability to take a true vacation and not have deals fall apart while you’re gone.</p>

<p class="section-title">Here’s what a few agents say about working with me…</p>

<p><span class="quote">"I started out brand new in real estate as a showing/buyer’s agent  on a high producing team with Katrina Madewell. I have learned and grown so much in a short period of time. Joining her team is one of the best decisions I have made." </span><br>
<span class="author">- Darshana</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"Katrina is very hands on & practical & allows you to make mistakes so you can learn from them.  In Role play, she helped with language to sharpen my skills & never gives me more than I can handle.  What I like the most about working here is how respectful Katrina is of my family time and allows me to put them first.   She is super flexible and will not micro manage you. Everyone around here has their part to do."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Chelsea</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"When I am with Katrina she is 100% hands on and will devote her full attention.  If I have a question she always helps me and is always looking to better me.  Just listening to Katrina on the phone she has helped me through improving my skills and helped me get out of my comfort zone.   This has let to lots of self betterment.
Having this TEAM is awesome because there is always someone around to help, and I love to gladly do the same for others when I help."</span><br>
<span class="author">- Jade</span></p>

<p><span class="quote">"The Training is detailed, with step by step tutorials that are easy to understand. She teaches in small bite size pieces vs hours worth of training for days on end.  She will teach, then let you do it, so you can apply what you have learned.   What I love most about working here is the day to day challenges, everyday is different, its not boring, I still learn from her everyday.  The work environment is VERY family oriented and Flexible, I have always been able to take time as needed."</span><br>

<p>You don’t need to pay a bunch of money to a real estate coach.</p>

<p>Why am I offering this?</p>

<p>I’ll help you for free in return that maybe, over the long term – and only if it makes sense - you’d like to learn more about working on our team. </p>

<p>Let me be clear that is not the intent of the meeting. That’s another conversation for another time and only if you have any interest.</p>

<p>I also figure we’ll do business together someday and I would like to get to know you. I enjoy seeing real estate agents succeed. It’s fulfilling, and I love it.</p>

<p>I invite you to request a free one-on-one business strategy meeting with me. We can meet for coffee, or even if it’s more convenient, a phone call or a video conference works, too.</p>

<p>I have a questionnaire I would like you to fill out so that when we meet so I’m prepared to offer you specific advice. When you request a call, I’ll email it to you to complete it before the meeting.</p>

<p>Look forward to meeting with you. Let’s grow your business.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Katrina Madewell</p>
