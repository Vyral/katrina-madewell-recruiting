<p>Dear Real Estate Agent,</p>

<p>I understand you may be freshly licensed and looking to make your mark in the industry, or perhaps are an agent with few months of experience under your belt but without much success to show for it. You understand your potential and are working hard to clear a path toward your goals, but currently lack the support you need to achieve them.</p>

<p>If this sounds familiar, you aren’t alone. Plenty of agents know what it’s like to feel lost in this industry—to pound the pavement, knock on strangers doors, and do whatever else you think it might take to finally break in to the career you deserve. All too often, agents in this situation will start throwing money in all the wrong directions in hopes that something sticks. In reality, though, all they’re doing is wasting their time (and resources) on activities that won’t bring in the income they’re hoping for.</p>

<p>Many brokerages promise to provide structure, coaching, and other resources but fail to show you a clear path on how to actually get you results. As a result of this and other factors, <strong>87% of all new agents fail within five years of working in the industry.</strong></p>

<p>Chances are, you didn’t get into real estate with the dream of someday returning to a 9-to-5 job or working 10+ hours a day, 7 days a week. But with so many agents winding up on just such a path, how can you make sure you don’t meet the same fate? How can you get to a point where instead of running your bank account dry just to stay in the business, you’re actually getting paid for your efforts?</p>

<p>The answer is simple: You give me a call.</p>

<p><strong>My name is Katrina Madewell, with Tampa Home Talk, and I understand what you’re going through.</strong> I got into real estate just before I turned 18, and in my nearly three decades’ worth of experience since, I’ve seen a lot of ups and downs in our industry—including the 2008 market crash. And in my time as an agent, I’ve seen plenty of people face the hardships you might be up against right now.</p>

<p>Thankfully, a handful of these people have come to me for help. They’ve seen what I can do for agents and clients alike, and they wanted to be a part of it.</p>

<p>So what sets my team and I apart?</p>

<p>For one thing, people here in Tampa know me as the “Realtor’s Realtor.” In other words, I’m the agent people call when they need help buying or selling a home. That’s because my focus has always been on people—not just numbers. I’ve built up a database of people who know, like, and trust me, and who would come to me before anyone else when they or someone they know wants to make a move. Because of this, I have the luxury of saying “no” to clients who aren’t a good fit. I’m not desperate to close deals, and you don’t have to be, either.</p>

<p>When you join my team, we’ll teach you how to be successful in real estate without sacrificing the other aspects of your life. I’ll show you exactly what it takes to build and maintain relationships with clients. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a steady flow of referrals to rely on, instead of having to chase down strangers?</p>

<p><strong>That’s exactly what we offer. When you join us, you gain access to:</strong>
<ul class="indent">
<li>Back-end support from our inside sales agent, listing manager, showing assistants, and transaction coordinators</li>
<li>A great work/life balance</li>
<li>Unlimited send-out cards</li>
<li>A brick-and-mortar office space</li>
<li>Weekly one-on-one coaching sessions</li>
<li>Proven systems, strategies, and resources to help you work your leads</li>
<li>Radio advertising on “Tampa Home Talk”</li>
<li>Pre-organized client events (at least three every year)</li>
<li>And much, much more</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Unlike other teams, our focus is on helping you guarantee a successful future—we do much more than just help you handle one sale at a time. Better still, you don’t have to worry about the many logistics of building your business. We’ve taken care of that for you. All you have to do is plug into our systems. We promise that if you follow all the steps we’ve laid out for you, you’ll start seeing results from your first week.</p>

<p>And if you don’t feel ready to start work as an agent right away, we’d be happy to help you start out slow as a showing assistant. Many agents find that this is a great way to gain experience, learn about the industry, and see what working for our team is really like before taking on deals of their own.</p>

<p>Darshana, an agent who followed this route herself, is the perfect example of this. When she came to us, she had no sense of direction in the industry. After working for a while as a showing assistant, however, she gained the knowledge, experience, and confidence necessary to take the next steps in her real estate career.</p>

<p>And Darshana’s story isn’t an outlier. We’re so confident in our systems that if you join us and close fewer than 12 deals in your first year, then we’ll pay for you to have additional third-party coaching.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the choice is yours. You could try your luck with another team, keep doing what you are now, or leave the industry altogether. Or you could join us and see what it’s like to love working in real estate and working with your clients. We make thriving in this industry simple—when you plug into our systems, you’ll see for yourself what a difference the right support can make.</p>

<p>Don’t let this opportunity pass you by. The chance to join our team won’t last forever. We only have a few spots open now, and there’s never been a better time to come on board. As you’ve probably noticed, the industry is changing. Disruptors are creeping in and being a successful agent isn’t quite as easy as it used to be. Things will only get more volatile moving forward, so it’s critical that you act soon.</p>

<p>Our support-oriented environment helps professionals learn, grow, and thrive. <strong>People join us because they want to succeed, make money, and serve our community.</strong> We understand that to reach those goals, you need support, coaching, resources, and leads—so that is exactly what we provide.</p>

<p>So what are you waiting for? It’s time to take control of your future and see firsthand how joining us can transform your life and career. The longer you wait to reach out, the longer you’re suppressing your true potential. Let’s have a conversation.</p>

<p>I look forward to talking to you soon!</p>
