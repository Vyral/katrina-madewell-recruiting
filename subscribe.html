<p>Dear Real Estate Agent:</p>

<p>Are you looking for training that teaches you exactly what you need to do to sell homes specifically right here in Tampa?</p>

<p>I invite you to subscribe to our free real estate agent training newsletter.</p>

<p>Every two weeks, we publish helpful tips for you; which include:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Real agent success stories</li>

</ol></p>

<p>Our goal is to give you a taste of the training we provide if you have any interest in working with us in the future.</p>

<p>We have no intention of recruiting you - that’s a conversation with us when you are ready, if at all.</p>

<p>Last year 48,161 homes sold in the greater Tampa Bay market.</p>

<p>That’s plenty of business to go around for all of us.</p>

<p>We’ve been fortunate to sell 81 homes last year and our average agent earns about $50,000 a year with us.</p>

<p>The same training they get will help you do it as well.</p>

<p>So, if you’re interested in knowing what we’re up to here, and you’d like to stay current on the latest strategies to:
<ol class="indent">
<li>Generate qualified seller leads</li>

<p><strong>Here’s what a few agents say about our free training:</strong></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"I started out brand new in real estate as a showing/buyer’s agent on a high producing team with Katrina Madewell. I have learned and grown so much in a short period of time. Joining her team is one of the best decisions I have made." <span class="testimonial-author">- Darshana</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"Katrina is very hands on & practical & allows you to make mistakes so you can learn from them. In Role play, she helped with language to sharpen my skills & never gives me more than I can handle. What I like the most about working here is how respectful Katrina is of my family time and allows me to put them first. She is super flexible and will not micromanage you. Everyone around here has their part to do." <span class="testimonial-author">- Chelsea</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"When I am with Katrina she is 100% hands on and will devote her full attention. If I have a question she always helps me and is always looking to better me. Just listening to Katrina on the phone she has helped me through improving my skills and helped me get out of my comfort zone. This has let to lots of self betterment. Having this TEAM is awesome because there is always someone around to help, and I love to gladly do the same for others when I help." <span class="testimonial-author">- Jade</span></p>

<p class="testimonial-text indent">"The Training is detailed, with step by step tutorials that are easy to understand. She teaches in small bite size pieces vs hours worth of training for days on end. She will teach, then let you do it, so you can apply what you have learned. What I love most about working here is the day to day challenges, everyday is different, it’s not boring, I still learn from her everyday. The work environment is VERY family oriented and Flexible, I have always been able to take time as needed." <span class="testimonial-author">- Kaye</span></p>
