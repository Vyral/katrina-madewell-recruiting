In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, what’s become the new normal for you? Here in Florida, real estate is still considered an essential service, so our new normal for doing business is vastly different from what it once was. But more importantly, how are you and your family doing? I’ve been reaching out to my clients and friends regularly to touch base, and as you can imagine, it’ll take a while to get through all of them. Let us know how you’re holding up, and if you know of anyone who has been impacted by coronavirus or if there’s something we can do to help, please reach out and let us know what we can do for you.
