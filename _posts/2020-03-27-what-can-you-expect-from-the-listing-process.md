Normally, our listing manager Chelsea Kunkel is busy coordinating the listing process with sellers and making sure their needs are attended to, but she was able to find some time today to help me explain what that process looks like.&nbsp;

**It all starts with me doing a room-by-room review of your home,** after which I leave a nicely structured report illustrating all of the things that need to be done to your home so it shows like a model one. This is also generally the time when we help sellers figure out if it’s in their best interest to have a pre-inspection done. Oftentimes, that depends on how long you’ve lived in the home and how much deferred maintenance we can readily see in your home when we walk through.&nbsp;

At this point, the torch is passed on to Chelsea, who then, with our stager, Kim, does another walk-through of your home. This ensures that a second set of eyes reviews your home so that nothing was missed. Also, the perspective of a professional stager opens up so much more potential for how well your home can show.&nbsp;

From there, Chelsea acts a vital liaison, executing the grand plan that we craft as a team. We pick a target date to go live on the market and narrow down the repairs or changes necessary to maximize your home sale. Chelsea comes in beautifully and works with you through the completion of that checklist.&nbsp;

She also helps coordinate professional photography, which is instrumental in your home making a great first impression online.&nbsp;

**Once your property goes live, Chelsea coordinates weekly updates,** letting you know how buyers are reacting to its price and how it’s performing overall on the market.&nbsp;

If you have any questions on the listing process, or want to speak with Chelsea a little bit more in depth, don’t hesitate to reach out. We’d love to hear from you and see how we can help your specific situation.&nbsp;
